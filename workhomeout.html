							<strong>Work Home Out, November 2013</strong>
							 <p>This project was a collaboration with James Barnett and Poppy French. Together we created an
								 immersive and sculptural installation in the Rose Lipman Building in Haggerston. The project's
								 starting point was James and Poppy's extensive and mundane photography collection, which we responded
								 to by creating three zones in the space: work, home, and out. As part of the installation visitors were
								 invited to interact with these three zones, using the disposable cameras provided to create 'instant nostalgia'.
								  This project was supported by Slashstroke Magazine and The Mill Co project and was in association with Create
									London and Go Visual Ltd.</p>
