<p><strong>The Perfume Hall | Friday 3 June 10am-1pm</strong></p><br>

<img src="img/perfume/1.gif">

<p><i>Poison resembles a magic fruit filled with belladonna, created for women who want
   the power of witchcraft *</i></p><br>

An exploration of Selfridges' Perfume Hall led by writer and fragrance specialist Pascale Cumming-Benson.<br>

<p>This event examined the interplay between the "feel" of a scent, experienced through smell, and its "look", along
  with the language used to describe and sell it. In doing so, the event unwrapped the processes involved in the creation
  and consumption of perfume; considering how desire and aspiration perform within the space of the "Perfume Hall".</p>

<p>Pascale Cumming-Benson is a writer and professional fragrance specialist at <i>Les Senteurs</i> - London's oldest scent salon.
  Pascale graduated from the Royal College of Art with an MA in Critical Writing in 2014. Her thesis <i>Osmic: An
  Essay on the Forms of Smell</i> confronted how smell has been historically devalued as the mysterious and unsociable sense.</p>

<p>This event was part of <a href="http://www.openschooleast.org/category/events/">Open Schools East's</a> 2016 public programme. </p>
