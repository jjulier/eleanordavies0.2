							<strong>You Are Here, November, 2014</strong>
							<p>	<i>You Are Here</i> was an experience-based art project that took place at Kingsgate Project Space and independent
									shops, cafes and public spaces along Kilburn High Road during October and November 2014. Together with Penelope Diaz,
									I led a team of volunteers from Camden Arts Centre to deliver the exhibition. We transformed Kingsgate Project Space
									into a Tourist Information Office, complete with <i>You Are Here</i> merchandise and themed tours for visitors. This
									project was funded by Camden Arts Centre, the Arts Council England and Camden Council.</p>
