							<strong>G.B.F Series, 2012</strong><br>
									<em>Thread, chrome, sponge, rollers, tape, aluminium, rubber, nylon, plastic, baby oil, bodyspray and hairspray.</em>
									<p>In appropriating the sculpting techniques of hairdressing, extensions and highlights are added to slowly modify and
										 enhance a sculpture's look. The process of making is rhythmic and compulsive; artworks often evolve gradually, accumulating
										 in mass over time. The compulsive desire to reconfigure, reinvent, re-cut and re-colour derives from the satisfaction gained
										 through succumbing to the lure of the surface. The process of overworking the sculptural surface is self-indulgent.</p>
