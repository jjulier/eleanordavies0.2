						<strong>Yesterday Is Now History, June 2014</strong>
						<p>I was awarded a three month bursary by Goldsmiths' College to research and curate
							an exhibition exploring the unusual array of objects found in the Lewisham Local
							History Society's archive. I worked with a team of volunteer archivists to deliver
							 a show, exploring the everyday ephemera and material culture of Lewisham. This
							 project was supported through the Santander graduate training scheme in partnership
							  with Goldsmiths' Department of Visual Cultures and the Enterprise Fund.</p>
